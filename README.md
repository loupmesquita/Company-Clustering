## Company Clustering Customers

A company has gathered data about its customers and would like to identify similar clients, in order to propose relevant products to new clients, based on their
features. This can be represented as a clustering problem. The data are stored in data.npy. They are 4 dimensional.
<br>
We are going to choose : <br> <br>
— two clustering methods <br> <br>
— two heuristics to choose a relevant number of clusters,<br> <br>
and perform different clusterings of this dataset (overall, 2 × 2 = 4 methods). We will use a different metric for each clustering method. We could for
instance use the standard euclidean metric for one method, and a different metric
for the other method, for instance based on a rescaling of the dimensions of the
data (hence, we could transform the data first, and apply a known metric on the
transformed data.) <br>
Lastly, we will compare and discuss the difference between the results of the different methods
we tried. And discuss whether one mehod (combination of the clustering method and
of heuristic) seems to give more interesting or clearer results than the others.
